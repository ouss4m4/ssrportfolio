            As the lead developer, i am responsibe on creating, maintaining, and
            promoting the use of digital solutions to help the company on it's
            mission towards digital transformation.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            - I Developed and published a
            <strong>cross-platform mobile app</strong> that allows customers to
            create purchase orders and monitor their progress. as well as
            invoices and payment papers..
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            - To ensure a synchronized ordering experience from multiple
            devices, I deployed a <strong>website</strong> connected to the same{' '}
            <strong>API</strong> as the mobile <b>app</b> through{' '}
            <b>web socket.</b>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            - We automated the invoicing and printing process by creating a
            <strong> desktop software</strong> that connected to an API
            developed on top of <strong>SAP B1 Service Layer.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            - Instead of using the <strong>ERP Client App</strong>, Sales orders
            are now created using a modern <strong>web app -PWA-</strong> with a
            customized <strong>UX/UI</strong> designed to expedite the ordering
            process.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            - We track orders from the point of creation and validation to
            packaging and shipment using mobile apps with{' '}
            <strong>QR scanners.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            - All repetitive procedures that were previously done manually are
            now handled via autonomous APIs thanks to{' '}
            <strong>Nodejs and Linux Cron.</strong>
